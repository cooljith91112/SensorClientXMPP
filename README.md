## XMPP Sensor Client Application
<hr>

This is a simple Sensor Client Application which can be used to communicate with [OpenWeatherMapSensor](https://github.com/PeterWaher/OpenWeatherMapSensor) or any other IoT Sensor which supports [IEEE P1451.99](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/XMPPI/IoT).

#### Notes
* For Device discovery search you can narrow down the search results with adding additional paramaters to the ```FindFriends``` method in TheClientV Class (Look for ```Search.Add```)

```Important : You need to have an API Key and Secret from a IoT Broker which supports IEEE P1451.99.```
